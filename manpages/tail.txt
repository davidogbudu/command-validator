NAME
    tail - output the last part of files

DESCRIPTION
    The tail command outputs the last part of files.

SYNOPSIS
    tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...

OPTIONS
   -c, --bytes=bytes			Output the last bytes bytes of each of the specified files.
   -n, --lines=number			Output the last number lines, instead of the last 10; or use -n +number to output lines starting with the Kth 
   -f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]	Output appended data as the file grows; -f, --follow, and --follow=descriptor are equivalent
   -F	Same as --follow=name --retry 
   --max-unchanged-stats=N		With --follow=name, reopen a FILE which has not changed size after N (default 5) iteration to see if it has been unlinked or renamed (this is the usual case of rotated log files).
   --pid=PID				With -f, terminate after process ID, PID dies 
   -q, --quiet, --silent		Never output headers giving file names 
   --retry				Keep trying to open a file even when it is or becomes inaccessible; useful when following by name, i.e., with --follow=name
   -s, --sleep-interval=N		With -f, sleep for approximately N seconds (default 1.0) between iterations. With inotify and --pid=P, check process P at least once every N seconds. 
   -v, --verbose			Always output headers giving file names 
   --help				Display this help and exit 
   --version				Output version information and exit

EXAMPLE
