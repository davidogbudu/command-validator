NAME
    ifconfig (Interface configurator) - display your IP address, network interfaces, transferred and received data information, configure a network interface. On most modern distributions ifconfig has been deprecated, use ip instead.

SYNOPSIS
       ifconfig [interface]

       ifconfig interface [aftype] options | address ...

OPTIONS
   interface                The name of the interface.
                            Usually a driver name followed by a unit number, eth0 = 1st Ethernet interface.

   up                       This flag causes the interface to be activated.
                            It is implicitly specified if an address is assigned to the interface.

   down                     This flag causes the driver for this interface to be shut down.

   [-]arp                   Enable or disable the use of the ARP protocol on this interface.

   [-]promisc               Enable or disable the promiscuous mode of the interface.
                            If selected, all packets on the network will be received by the interface.

   [-]allmulti              Enable or disable all-multicast mode.
                            If selected, all multicast packets on the network will be received by the interface.

   metric N                 Set the interface metric.

   mtu N                    Set the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of an interface.
                            To make this change permanent, edit:
                            /etc/network/interfaces    Debian / Ubuntu
                            /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0   CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

   dstaddr addr             Set the remote IP address for a point-to-point (PPP) link (obsolete; use pointopoint instead)

   netmask addr             Set the IP network mask for this interface.
                            This value defaults to the usual class A, B, or C network mask
                            (as derived from the interface IP address), but it can be set to any value.

   add addr/prefixlen       Add an IPv6 address to an interface.

   del addr/prefixlen       Remove an IPv6 address from an interface.

   tunnel aa.bb.cc.dd       Create a new SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) device, tunnelling to the given destination.

   irq addr                 Set the interrupt line used by this device.
                            Not all devices can dynamically change their IRQ setting.

   io_addr addr             Set the start address in I/O space for this device.

   mem_start addr           Set the start address for shared memory used by this device.
                            Only a few devices need this.

   media type               Set the physical port or medium type to be used by the device.
                            Not all devices can change this setting, and those that can vary
                            in what values they support. Typical values for type are 10base2 (thin Ethernet),
                            10baseT (twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet), AUI (external transceiver), and so on.
                            The special medium type of auto can be used to tell the driver to auto-sense the
                            media. Again, not all drivers can do this.

   [-]broadcast [addr]      If the address argument is given, set the protocol broadcast address
                            for this interface. Otherwise, set (or clear) the IFF_BROADCAST flag for
                            the interface.

   [-]pointopoint [addr]    This keyword enables the point-to-point mode of an interface, meaning that
                            it is a direct link between two machines with nobody else listening on it.
                            If the address argument is also given, set the protocol address of the other
                            side of the link, just like the obsolete dstaddr keyword does.
                            Otherwise, set or clear the IFF_POINTOPOINT flag for the interface.

   hw class address         Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device driver supports
                            this operation. The keyword must be followed by the name of the hardware class
                            and the printable ASCII equivalent of the hardware address. Hardware classes
                            currently supported include ether (Ethernet), ax25 (AMPR AX.25), ARCnet, and
                            netrom (AMPR NET/ROM).

   multicast                Set the multicast flag on the interface. Not normally needed as
                            the drivers set the flag correctly themselves.

   address                  The IP address to be assigned to this interface.

   txqueuelen length        Set the length of the transmit queue of the device.
                            It is useful to set this to small values for slower devices with a high
                            latency (modem links, ISDN) to prevent fast bulk transfers from disturbing
                            interactive traffic like telnet too much.
