NAME
    sed - stream editor

DESCRIPTION
    The sed command is a stream editor used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).

SYNOPSIS
    sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...

OPTIONS
   -n, --quiet, --silent                            suppress automatic printing of pattern space
   -e script, --expression=script                   add the script to the commands to be executed
   -f script-file, --file=script-file               add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed
   --follow-symlinks                                follow symlinks when processing in place; hard links will still be broken
   -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]                  edit files in place (makes backup if extension supplied). The default operation mode is to break symbolic and hard links. This can be changed with --follow-symlinks and --copy
   -c, --copy                                       use copy instead of rename when shuffling files in -i mode. While this will avoid breaking links (symbolic or hard), the resulting editing operation is not atomic. This is rarely the desired mode; --follow-symlinks is usually enough, and it is both faster and more secure
   -l N, --line-length=N                            specify the desired line-wrap length for the 'l' command
   --posix                                          disable all GNU extensions
   -r, --regexp-extended                            use extended regular expressions in the script
   -s, --separate                                   consider files as separate rather than as a single continuous long stream
   -u, --unbuffered                                 load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush the output buffers more often
   --help                                           display this help and exit
   --version                                        output version information and exit

EXAMPLE
