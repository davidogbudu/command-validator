NAME
    mv - Move or rename files or directories.

SYNOPSIS
    mv [options]... Source Dest
    mv [options]... Source... Directory

DESCRIPTION
    If the last argument names an existing directory, 'mv' moves each other given file into a file with the same name in that directory. Otherwise, if only two files are given, it renames the first as the second. It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more than two files are given.

OPTIONS
   -b, --backup                  	Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or removed.

   -f, --force                   	Remove existing destination files and never prompt the user.

   -i, --interactive             	Prompt whether to overwrite each existing destination file, regardless of its permissions. If the response does not begin with 'y' or 'Y', the file is skipped.

   -S SUFFIX, --suffix=SUFFIX    	Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with '-b'. The backup suffix is ~, unless set with SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.

   -u, --update                  	Do not move a nondirectory that has an existing destination with the same or newer modification time.

   -v, --verbose                 	Print the name of each file before moving it.

   -V METHOD, --version-control=METHOD	Change the type of backups made with '-b'. METHOD can be:

                                  	t, numbered     make numbered backups
                                  	nil, existing   numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
                                  	never, simple   always make simple backups

   --help                         	Display help and exit.
