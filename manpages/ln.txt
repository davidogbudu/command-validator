NAME
    ln - create links between files

DESCRIPTION
    The ln command creates links between files. By default, it creates hard links.

SYNOPSIS
    ln [OPTION]... TARGET [LINK_NAME]
    ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY

OPTIONS
--backup[=CONTROL]                     Make a backup of each existing destination file.
-b                                     Like --backup but does not accept an argument.
-d, -F, --directory                    Allow the superuser to attempt to hard link directories (note: will probably fail due to system restrictions, even for the superuser).
-f, --force                            Remove existing destination files.
-i, --interactive                      Prompt whether to remove destinations.
-L, --logical                          Make hard links to symbolic link references.
-n, --no-dereference                   Treat destination that is a symlink to a directory as if it were a normal file.
-P, --physical                         Make hard links directly to symbolic links.
-s, --symbolic                         Make symbolic links instead of hard links.
-S, --suffix=SUFFIX                    Override the usual backup suffix.
-t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY       Specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links.
-T, --no-target-directory              Treat NewLinkFile as a normal file.
-v, --verbose                          Print name of each linked file.
--help                                 Display this help and exit.
--version                              Output version information and exit.
