NAME
    df - Disk Free - display free disk space.

SYNOPSIS
    df [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
    The df utility displays the amount of disk space available on the file systems. 
    With no arguments, 'df' reports the space used and available on all currently 
    mounted filesystems (of all types). Otherwise, 'df' reports on the filesystem 
    containing each specified FILE.

OPTIONS
    -a, --all                              Include in the listing filesystems that have a size of 0 blocks, 
                                           which are omitted by default. Typically special-purpose 
                                           pseudo-filesystems, such as automounter entries, or filesystems 
                                           of type "ignore" or "auto".

    -h, --human-readable                   Append a size letter such as 'M' for megabytes to each size. 
                                           Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; 'M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.

    -H, --si                               Append a size letter such as 'M' for megabytes to each size.
                                           Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; 'M' stands for 1,000,000 bytes.

    -i, --inodes                           List inode usage information instead of block usage. An inode contains 
                                           information about a file, such as its owner, permissions, timestamps, 
                                           and location on the disk.

    -k, --kilobytes                        Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size.

    -l, --local                            Limit the listing to local filesystems. By default, remote 
                                           filesystems are also listed.

    -m, --megabytes                        Print sizes in megabyte (1,048,576-byte) blocks.

    --no-sync                              Do not invoke the 'sync' system call before getting any usage data. 
                                           This can make 'df' run faster but results may be slightly out of date.

    -P, --portability                      Use the POSIX output format. Ensures each filesystem's information 
                                           is always printed on one line, even if the mount device name is long.

    --sync                                 Invoke the 'sync' system call before getting any usage data. This 
                                           may provide more up-to-date results on some systems but can make 
                                           'df' slower.

    -t FSTYPE, --type=FSTYPE               Limit the listing to filesystems of type FSTYPE. Multiple types 
                                           can be specified with multiple '-t' options.

    -T, --print-type                       Print each filesystem’s type. Common types include 'nfs' for network 
                                           file systems, 'ufs' for local hard disks, 'hsfs' or 'cdfs' for CD-ROMs, 
                                           and 'pcfs' for MS-DOS filesystems.

    -x FSTYPE, --exclude-type=FSTYPE       Limit the listing to filesystems not of type FSTYPE. Multiple 
                                           types can be excluded with multiple '-x' options.

    -v                                     Ignored; for compatibility with System V versions of 'df'.
