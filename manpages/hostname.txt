NAME
       hostname -- set or print name of current host system

SYNOPSIS
       hostname [-f] [-s | -d] [name-of-host]

DESCRIPTION
       The hostname utility prints the name of the current host. The super-
       user can set the hostname by supplying an argument; this is usually
       done in the initialization script /etc/rc.d/hostname, normally run at
       boot time. This script uses the hostname variable in /etc/rc.conf.

OPTIONS

       -f                 Include domain information in the printed name. This is the default behavior.

       -s                 Trim off any domain information from the printed name.

       -d                 Only print domain information.


EXAMPLE
