
NAME
    dd - Data Duplicator, convert and copy a file, write disk headers, boot records, create a boot floppy.

SYNOPSIS
    dd [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
    The dd utility is used to convert and copy files. It can create exact clones of disks (including unmounted ones),
    write disk headers, and create bootable floppies. When cloning disks, the output destination must be at least as
    large as the input to accommodate all data, including blank space.

OPTIONS
    if=FILE             Input file: Read from FILE instead of standard input.
                        Example: if=/dev/sda

    of=FILE             Output file: Write to FILE instead of standard output.
                        Unless 'conv=notrunc' is given, 'dd' truncates FILE to zero bytes 
                        (or the size specified with 'seek=').
                        Example: of=/dev/sdb

    bs=BYTES            Block size: Both read and write BYTES bytes at a time. This overrides 'ibs' and 'obs'.
                        Example: bs=4M

    ibs=BYTES           Input block size: Read BYTES bytes at a time.
                        Example: ibs=512

    obs=BYTES           Output block size: Write BYTES bytes at a time.
                        Example: obs=1M

    cbs=BYTES           Convert block size: Convert BYTES bytes at a time.
                        Example: cbs=1024

    count=N             Copy N input blocks (of 'ibs'-byte size) from the input file, instead of copying everything.
                        Example: count=100

    skip=N              Skip N input blocks before copying.
                        Example: skip=10

    seek=N              Skip N output blocks before writing.
                        Example: seek=5

    iflag=FLAGS         Read as per the comma separated symbol list.
                        Example: iflag=direct

    oflag=FLAGS         Write as per the comma separated symbol list.
                        Example: oflag=sync

    status=LEVEL        The LEVEL of information to print to stderr.
                        'none' suppress everything but error messages.
                        'noxfer' suppress the final transfer statistics.
                        'progress' show periodic transfer statistics.
                        Example: status=progress
