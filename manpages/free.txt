NAME

       free - Display amount of free and used memory in the system


SYNOPSIS

       free [option ...]


DESCRIPTION

       free displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap
       memory in the system, as well as the buffers and caches used by
       the kernel. The information is gathered by parsing /proc/meminfo.



OPTIONS

       -b, --bytes                                 Display the amount of memory in bytes.

       -k, --kibi                                  Display the amount of memory in kibibytes. This is the

       -h, --human                                 Show all output fields automatically scaled to shortest
                                                  three digit unit and display the units of print out.
                                                  Following units are used:

                                                    B = bytes
                                                    Ki = kibibyte
                                                    Mi = mebibyte
                                                    Gi = gibibyte
                                                    Ti = tebibyte
                                                    Pi = pebibyte

                                                  If unit is missing, and you have exbibyte of RAM or swap,
                                                  the number is in tebibytes and columns might not be
                                                  aligned with header.

       -w, --wide                                  Switch to the wide mode. The wide mode produces lines
                                                  longer than 80 characters. In this mode buffers and cache
                                                  are reported in two separate columns.

       -c, --count count                           Display the result count times. Requires the -s option.

       -l, --lohi                                  Show detailed low and high memory statistics.

       -L, --line                                  Show output on a single line, often used with the -s
                                                  option to show memory statistics repeatedly.

       -s, --seconds delay                         Continuously display the result delay seconds apart. You
                                                  may actually specify any floating point number for delay
                                                  using either . or , for decimal point. usleep(3) is used
                                                  for microsecond resolution delay times.

       --si                                       Use kilo, mega, giga etc (power of 1000) instead of kibi,
                                                  mebi, gibi (power of 1024).

       -t, --total                                 Display a line showing the column totals.

       -v, --committed                             Display a line showing the memory commit limit and amount
                                                  of committed/uncommitted memory. The total column on this
                                                  line will display the memory commit limit. This line is
                                                  relevant if memory overcommit is disabled.

       --help                                     Print help.

       -V, --version                              Display version information.
