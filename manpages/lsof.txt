DESCRIPTION
       An open file can be a regular file, a directory, a block special file, a
       character special file, an executing text reference, a library, a stream
       or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket). A
       specific file or all the files in a file system can be selected by path.

OPTIONS
       -? -h                                Display usage (help) output list.
       -a                                   Causes list selection options to be ANDed.
       -A A                                 Specifies an alternate name list file A for AFS.
       -b                                   Avoids kernel functions that might block.
       -c c                                 Lists files for processes executing the command that begins with c.
       +c w                                 Sets the maximum number of initial characters of the UNIX command.
       -C                                   Disables the reporting of any path name components from the kernel’s name cache.
       -d s                                 Specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude/include.
       -D D                                 Directs lsof’s use of the device cache file with functions: b (build), i (ignore), r (read), u (read and update).
       -g [s]                               Excludes or selects files for processes with process group ID numbers in s.
       -i [i]                               Lists files whose Internet address matches i.
       -k k                                 Specifies a kernel name list file k.
       -l                                   Inhibits the conversion of user ID numbers to login names.
       +|-L [l]                             Enables (+) or disables (-) listing of file link counts.
       +|-m m                               Specifies an alternate kernel memory file or activates mount table processing.
       +|-M                                 Enables (+) or disables (-) reporting of portmapper registrations.
       -n                                   Inhibits conversion of network numbers to host names.
       -N                                   Selects listing of NFS files.
       -o                                   Always displays file offsets, changing the SIZE/OFF column title to OFFSET.
       -O                                   Bypasses strategy to avoid blocking by some kernel operations.
       -p s                                 Excludes or selects listing of files for processes with process ID numbers in s.
       -P                                   Inhibits conversion of port numbers to port names.
       +|-r [t]                             Puts lsof in repeat mode, listing open files, delaying t seconds, then repeating.
       -R                                   Lists the Parent Process IDentification number in the PPID column.
       -s                                   Always displays file size, changing the SIZE/OFF column title to SIZE.
       -S [t]                               Specifies a time-out value t for kernel functions.
       -T [t]                               Controls reporting of TCP/TPI information, including socket options, queue lengths, connection states, and window sizes.
       -t                                   Produces terse output with process identifiers only.
       -u s                                 Lists files for users with login names or user ID numbers in s.
       -U                                   Selects listing of UNIX domain socket files.
       -v                                   Displays lsof version information.
       -V                                   Indicates items lsof was asked to list and failed to find.
       +|-w                                 Enables (+) or disables (-) suppression of warning messages.
       -x [fl]                             Directs processing to cross symbolic links and/or file system mount points.
       -X                                   A dialect-specific option with details for specific UNIX dialects.
       -z [z]                               Specifies how Solaris 10 and higher zone information is handled.
       -Z [Z]                               Specifies how SELinux security contexts are handled.

       --                                  Marks the end of options, useful when filenames start with a dash.
