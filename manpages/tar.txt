SYNOPSIS
     tar [[-]function] [options] filenames...

      tar [[-]function] [options] -C directory-name...

Functions:
   Exactly one of the following functions (shown in bold) must be specified:
   -A --catenate --concatenate  	Append the contents of named file, which must itself be a gnutar archive, to the end of the archive (erasing the old end-of-archive block).
   -c --create     			Create a new archive (or truncate an old one) and write the named files to it.
   -d --diff --compare    		Find differences between files in the archive and corresponding files in the file system.
   --delete     			Delete named files from the archive.
   -r --append     			Append files to the end of an archive.
   -t --list       			List the contents of an archive; if filename arguments are given, only those files are listed, otherwise the entire table of contents is listed.
   --test-label   			Test the archive volume label and exit
   -u --update     			Append the named files if the on-disk version has a modification date more recent than their copy in the archive(if any). 
   -x --extract --get        		Extract files from an archive.  The owner, modification time, and file permissions are restored, if possible. If no file arguments are given, extract all the files in the archive.
   -C, --directory=DIR     		change to directory DIR
   -f, --file=ARCHIVE     		use archive file or device ARCHIVE
