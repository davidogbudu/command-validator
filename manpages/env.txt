NAME
       env -- set environment and execute command, or print environment

SYNOPSIS
       env [-0iv] [-L|-U user[/class]] [-u name] [name=value ...]
       env  [-iv]  [-L|-U  user[/class]]  [-P  altpath]  [-S string] [-u name]
       [name=value ...] utility [argument ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The env utility executes another utility after modifying the environment
       as specified on the command line. Each name=value option specifies the
       setting of an environment variable, name, with a value of value. All such
       environment variables are set before the utility is executed.

OPTIONS

       -0                              End each output line with NUL, not newline.

       -i                              Execute the utility with only those environment
                                       variables specified by name=value options.
                                       The environment inherited by env is ignored
                                       completely.

       -L | -U user[/class]             Add the environment variable definitions from
                                       login.conf(5) for the specified user and login
                                       class to the environment, after processing any
                                       -i or -u options, but before processing any
                                       name=value options. If -L is used, only the
                                       system-wide /etc/login.conf.db file is read;
                                       if -U is used, then the specified user's
                                       ~/.login_conf is read as well. The user may be
                                       specified by name or by uid. If a username of
                                       `-' is given, then no user lookup will be done,
                                       the login class will default to `default' if not
                                       explicitly given, and no substitutions will be
                                       done on the values.

       -P altpath                       Search the set of directories as specified by
                                       altpath to locate the specified utility program,
                                       instead of using the value of the PATH environment
                                       variable.

       -S string                        Split apart the given string into multiple
                                       strings, and process each of the resulting
                                       strings as separate arguments to the env utility.
                                       The -S option recognizes some special character
                                       escape sequences and also supports environment-
                                       variable substitution, as described below.

       -u name                          If the environment variable name is in the
                                       environment, then remove it before processing
                                       the remaining options. This is similar to the
                                       unset command in sh(1). The value for name must
                                       not include the `=' character.

       -v                              Print verbose information for each step of
                                       processing done by the env utility. Additional
                                       information will be printed if -v is specified
                                       multiple times.
