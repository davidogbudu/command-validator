NAME
    rm - remove files or directories

DESCRIPTION
    The rm command removes (deletes) files or directories.

SYNOPSIS
    rm [OPTION]... FILE...

OPTIONS
   -f, --force              Ignore nonexistent files, never prompt.
   -i                       Prompt before every removal.
   -I                       Prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively.
                            Less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes.
   --interactive[=WHEN]     Prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i). Without WHEN, prompt always.
   --one-file-system        When removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argument.
   --no-preserve-root       Do not treat '/' specially.
   --preserve-root          Do not remove '/' (default).
   -r, -R, --recursive      Remove directories and their contents recursively.
   -v, --verbose            Explain what is being done.
   --help                   Display this help and exit.
   --version                Output version information and exit.
