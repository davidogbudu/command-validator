NAME
    whereis - locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command

DESCRIPTION
    The whereis command locates the binary, source, and manual page files for a command.

SYNOPSIS
     whereis [options] [-BMS directory... -f] name...

OPTIONS
    -b			earch for binaries.
    -m			Search for manuals.
    -s			Search for sources.
    -u			Only show the command names that have unusual entries.
    -B list		Limit the places where whereis searches for binaries, by a whitespace-separated list of directories.
    -M list		Limit the places where whereis searches for manuals and documentation in Info format, by a whitespace-separated list of directories.
    -S list		Limit the places where whereis searches for sources, by a whitespace-separated list of directories.
    -f			Terminates the directory list and signals the start of filenames. It must be used when any of the -B, -M, or -S options is used.
    -l			Output the list of effective lookup paths that whereis is using. When none of -B, -M, or -S is specified, the option will output the hard-coded paths that the command was able to find on the system.
    -g			Interpret the next names as a glob(7) patterns. whereis always compares only filenames (aka basename) and never complete path. Using directory names in the pattern has no effect.
    -h, --help		Display help text and exit.
    -V, --version	Print version and exit.

EXAMPLE
    whereis ls
