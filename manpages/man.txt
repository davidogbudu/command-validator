SYNOPSIS
       man [-acdfFhkKtwW] [--path] [-m system] [-p string] [-C config_file]
              [-M pathlist] [-P pager] [-B browser] [-H htmlpager] [-S section_list]

                 [section] name ...
DESCRIPTION
 	man is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.

OPTIONS
   -C config_file                   The configuration file to use; the default is /etc/man.config. 
                                    (See man.config(5).) 

   -M path                          The list of directories to search for man pages. Separate the 
                                    directories with colons. An empty list is the same as not 
                                    specifying -M at all. See SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES. 

   -P pager                         Which pager to use. This option overrides the MANPAGER 
                                    environment variable, which in turn overrides the PAGER 
                                    variable. By default, man uses /usr/bin/less -is. 

   -B                               Which browser to use on HTML files. This option overrides the 
                                    BROWSER environment variable. By default, man uses 
                                    /usr/bin/less-is.

   -H                               Specify a command that renders HTML files as text. This option 
                                    overrides the HTMLPAGER environment variable. By default, 
                                    man uses /bin/cat.

   -S section_list                  List is a colon separated list of manual sections to search. 
                                    This option overrides the MANSECT environment variable.

   -a                               By default, man will exit after displaying the first manual page 
                                    it finds. Using this option forces man to display all the 
                                    manual pages that match name, not just the first.

   -c                               Reformat the source man page, even when an up-to-date cat page 
                                    exists. This can be meaningful if the cat page was formatted 
                                    for a screen with a different number of columns, or if the 
                                    preformatted page is corrupted.

   -d                               Don’t actually display the man pages, but do print gobs of 
                                    debugging information.

   -D                               Both display and print debugging info.

   -f                               Equivalent to whatis.

   -F --preformat                   Format only - do not display.

   -h                               Print a help message and exit.

   -k                               Equivalent to apropos.

   -K                               Search for the specified string in *all* man pages. Warning: 
                                    this can be very slow and can match multiple pages! It helps 
                                    to specify a section.

   -m system                        Specify an alternate set of man pages to search based on the 
                                    system name given.

   -p string                        Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or 
                                    troff. Not all installations will have a full set of 
                                    preprocessors. Some of the preprocessors and the letters 
                                    used to designate them: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), 
                                    vgrind (v), refer (r). This option overrides the MANROFFSEQ 
                                    environment variable.

   -t                               Use /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc to format the manual page, 
                                    passing the output to stdout. The default output format of 
                                    /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc is Postscript, refer to the 
                                    manual page of /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc for ways to pick 
                                    an alternate format. Depending on the selected format and the 
                                    availability of printing devices, the output may need to be 
                                    passed through some filter or another before being printed.

   -w --path                        Don’t actually display the man pages, but do print the location(s) 
                                    of the files that would be formatted or displayed. If no argument 
                                    is given: display (on stdout) the list of directories that is 
                                    searched by man for man pages. If manpath is a link to man, then 
                                    "manpath" is equivalent to "man --path".

   -W                               Like -w, but print file names one per line, without additional 
                                    information. This is useful in shell commands like man -aW man 
                                    | xargs ls -l.
