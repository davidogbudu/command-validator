NAME
    	umount - unmount file systems

DESCRIPTION
    	The umount command detaches the file system(s) mentioned from the file hierarchy.

SYNOPSIS
    	umount [-hV]
	umount -a [-dflnrv] [-t vfstype] [-O options]
	umount [-dflnrv] {dir|device}...

OPTIONS
	-V			Print version and exit.
	-h			Print help message and exit.
	-v			Verbose mode.
	-n			Unmount without writing in /etc/mtab.
	-r			In case unmounting fails, try to remount read-only.
	-d			In case the unmounted device was a loop device, also free this loop device.
	-i			Don't call the /sbin/umount.<filesystem> helper even if it exists. By default /sbin/umount.<filesystem> helper is called if one exists.
	-a			All of the file systems described in /etc/mtab are unmounted. (With umount version 2.7 and later: the proc filesystem is not unmounted.)
	-t vfstype		Indicate that the actions should only be taken on file systems of the specified type. More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list. The list of file system types can be prefixed with no to specify the file system types on which no action should be taken.
	-O options		Indicate that the actions should only be taken on file systems with the specified options in /etc/fstab. More than one option type may be specified in a comma separated list. Each option can be prefixed with no to specify options for which no action should be taken.
	-f			Force unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system). (Requires kernel 2.1.116 or later.)
	-l			Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore. (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)
	--no-canonicalize	Don't canonicalize paths. For more details about this option see the mount(8) man page.
	--fake			Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; this ''fakes'' unmounting the filesystem. It can be used to remove entries from /etc/mtab that were unmounted earlier with the -n option.
EXAMPLE
    umount /mnt/point
    umount -l /mnt/point
