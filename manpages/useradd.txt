NAME
    useradd - create a new user or update default new user information

DESCRIPTION
    The useradd command creates a new user or updates default user information.

SYNOPSIS
    useradd [OPTION]... USERNAME

OPTIONS
      --badname						Allow names that do not conform to standards.
      -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR				The default base directory for the system if -d HOME_DIR is not specified.  BASE_DIR is concatenated with the account name to define the home directory.
      -c, --comment COMMENT				Any text string. It is generally a short description of the account, and is currently used as the field for the user's full name.
      -d, --home-dir HOME_DIR				The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the user's login directory.
      -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE      		The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
      -f, --inactive INACTIVE				defines the number of days after the password exceeded its maximum age where the user is expected to replace this password. The value is stored in the shadow password file. An input of 0 will disable an expired password with no delay.
      -F, --add-subids-for-system			Update /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid even when creating a system account with -r option.
      -g, --gid GROUP					The name or the number of the user's primary group. The group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group.
      -G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]	A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of. Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same restrictions as the group given with the -g option.
      -h, --help					Display help message and exit.
      -k, --skel SKEL_DIR				The skeleton directory, which contains files and directories to be copied in the user's home directory, when the home directory is created by useradd.
      -K, --key KEY=VALUE				Overrides /etc/login.defs defaults (UID_MIN, UID_MAX, UMASK, PASS_MAX_DAYS and others).
      -l, --no-log-init					Do not add the user to the lastlog and faillog databases.
      -m, --create-home					Create the user's home directory if it does not exist. The files and directories contained in the skeleton directory (which can be defined with the -k option) will be copied to the home directory.
      -M, --no-create-home				Do not create the user's home directory, even if the system wide setting from /etc/login.defs (CREATE_HOME) is set to yes.
      -N, --no-user-groupDo				not create a group with the same name as the user, but add the user to the group specified by the -g option or by the GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd.
      -o, --non-unique					allows the creation of an account with an already existing UID.
      -p, --password PASSWORD				defines an initial password for the account. PASSWORD is expected to be encrypted, as returned by crypt (3). Within a shell script, this option allows to create efficiently batches of users.
      -r, --system					Create a system account.
      -R, --root CHROOT_DIR				Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only absolute paths are supported.
      -P, --prefix PREFIX_DIR				Apply changes to configuration files under the root filesystem found under the directory PREFIX_DIR. This option does not chroot and is intended for preparing across-compilation target.
      -s, --shell SHELL					sets the path to the user's login shell. Without this option, the system will use the SHELL variable specified in /etc/default/useradd, or, if that is as well not set, the field for the login shell in /etc/passwd remains empty.
      -u, --uid UID					The numerical value of the user's ID. This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used. The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the smallest ID value greater than or equal to UID_MIN and greater than every other user.
      -U, --user-group					Create a group with the same name as the user, and add the user to this group.
      -Z, --selinux-user SEUSER				defines the SELinux user for the new account. Without this option, SELinux uses the default user. Note that the shadow system doesn't store the selinux-user, it uses semanage(8 for that).
      --selinux-range SERANGE				defines the SELinux MLS range for the new account. Without this option, SELinux uses the default range. Note that the shadow system doesn't store the selinux-range, it uses semanage(8) for that.
