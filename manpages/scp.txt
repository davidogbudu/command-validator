NAME
    scp - secure copy (remote file copy program)

DESCRIPTION
    The scp command copies files between hosts on a network.

SYNOPSIS
    scp [-1246BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
        [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
        [ [user@]host1:]file1 [...] [ [user@]host2:]file2

OPTIONS
   -1                      Force scp to use protocol 1.
   -2                      Force scp to use protocol 2.
   -4                      Force scp to use IPv4 addresses only.
   -6                      Force scp to use IPv6 addresses only.
   -B                      Select batch mode (don't ask for passwords or passphrases).
   -C                      Compression, passes the -C flag to ssh to enable compression.
   -c cipher               Select the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer. This option is directly passed to ssh.
   -F ssh_config           Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh. This option is directly passed to ssh.
   -i identity_file        Select the file from which the identity (private key) for RSA authentication is read. This option is directly passed to ssh.
   -l limit                Limit the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.
   -o ssh_option           Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in ssh_config(5). This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate scp command-line flag.
   -P port                 The port to connect to on the remote host. Note that this option is written with a capital 'P', because -p is already reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file in rcp(1).
   -p                      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.
   -q                      Disables the progress meter.
   -r                      Recursively copy entire directories.
   -S program              Name of program to use for the encrypted connection. The program must understand ssh options.
   -v                      Verbose mode. Causes scp and ssh to print debugging messages about their progress. This is helpful in debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.

EXAMPLE
    scp file.txt user@remote:/path/to/destination
    scp -r directory/ user@remote:/path/to/destination
