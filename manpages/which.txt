NAME
    which - locate a command

DESCRIPTION
    The which command locates a command by searching the directories listed in PATH.

SYNOPSIS
    which [OPTION]... COMMAND...

OPTIONS
    --all, -a			Print all matching executables in PATH, not just the first.
    --read-alias, -i		Read aliases from stdin, reporting matching ones on stdout. This is useful in combination with using an alias for which itself.
    --skip-alias		Ignore option --read-alias, if any.  This is useful to explicity search for normal binaries, while using the --read-alias option in an alias for which.
    --skip-dot			Skip directories in PATH that start with a dot.
    --skip-tilde		Skip directories in PATH that start with a tilde and executables which reside in the HOME directory.
    --show-dot			If a directory in PATH starts with a dot and a matching executable was found for that path, then print "./program_name" rather than the full path.
    --show-tilde		Output a tilde when a directory matches the HOME directory.
    --tty-only			Stop processing options on the right if not on tty.
    --version, -v, -V		Print version information on standard output then exit successfully.
    --help			Print usage information on standard output then exit successfully.

EXAMPLE
