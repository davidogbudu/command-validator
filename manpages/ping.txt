NAME
    ping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts

DESCRIPTION
    The ping command sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts and reports on their response times.

SYNOPSIS
    ping [OPTION]... DESTINATION

OPTIONS
   -a                        Audible ping. This removes the need to look at the ping output.

   -A                        Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so that effectively not more than one (or more, if preload is set) unanswered probes
                             present in the network.

   -b                        Allow pinging a broadcast address. 

   -B                        Do not allow ping to change source address of probes. The address is bound to one selected when ping starts.

   -c count                  Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.

   -d                        Debug, Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

   -F flow_label             Allocate and set 20 bit flow label on echo request packets. (Only ping6).
                             If value is zero, kernel allocates random flow label.

   -f                        Flood ping, output packets as fast as they come back or 100 times per second.

   -i wait                   Set an interval of wait seconds between sending each packet. default=one second.
                             Only super-user can set wait to values less 0.2 seconds.
                             (incompatible with -f)

   -I interface address      Set source address to specified interface_address.
                             Argument can be numeric IP address or name of device.
                             Required when pinging an IPv6 link-local address.

   -l preload                If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets as fast as
                             possible before falling into its normal mode of behavior.
                             Only the super-user can select preload more than 3.

   -L                        Suppress loopback of multicast packets.
                             only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

   -n                        Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
                             names for host addresses.

   -p pattern                Specify up to 16 'pad' bytes to fill out the packet sent.
                             This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
                             network. eg, '-p ff' will fill the packet sent with all ones.

   -q                        Quiet output. Only display the summary lines at startup time and when finished.

   -Q tos                    Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams. tos can be a decimal or hex number.
                             Multiple TOS bits should not be set simultaneously. For detail see RFC1349 and RFC2474

   -R                        Record route(IPv4 only). Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and
                             display the route buffer on returned packets.

   -r                        Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.

   -s packetsize             The number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates into
                             64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.

   -S sndbuf                 Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not more than one packet.

   -t ttl                    Set the IP Time to Live.

   -T timestamp_option       Set special IP timestamp options, either 'tsonly' (only timestamps),
                             'tsandaddr' (timestamps and addresses)
                             or 'tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]]' (timestamp prespecified hops).

   -M hint                   Select Path MTU Discovery strategy. hint can be either 'do' (prohibit fragmentation,
                             even local one), 'want' (do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large),
                             or 'dont' (do not set DF flag).

   -U                        Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour).
                             Normally ping prints network round trip time, which can be different f.e. due to DNS failures.

   -v                        Verbose output. ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are received are listed.

   -w deadline               A timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or received.
                             In this case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline expire
                             or until count probes are answered or for some error notification from the network.

   -W timeout                Time to wait for a response, in seconds.
                             This option affects only the ICMP timeout in the absense of any responses, otherwise ping waits for two RTTs.
