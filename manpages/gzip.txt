NAME
   gzip, gunzip, zcat -- compression/decompression tool using Lempel-Ziv
   coding (LZ77)

SYNOPSIS
   gzip [-cdfhkLlNnqrtVv] [-S suffix] file [file [...]]
   gunzip [-cfhkLNqrtVv] [-S suffix] file [file [...]]
   zcat [-fhV] file [file [...]]


DESCRIPTION
   The gzip program compresses and decompresses files using Lempel-Ziv
   coding (LZ77). If no files are specified, gzip will compress from
   standard input, or decompress to standard output. When in compression
   mode, each file will be replaced with another file with the suffix, set
   by the -S suffix option, added, if possible.

   In decompression mode, each file will be checked for existence, as will
   the file with the suffix added. Each file argument must contain a sep-
   arate complete archive; when multiple files are indicated, each is de-
   compressed in turn.

  

OPTIONS
   -1, --fast                                  These options change the compression level used, with
   -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8                  the -1 option being the fastest, with less compres-
                                               sion, and the -9 option being the slowest, with opti-
                                               mal compression. The default compression level is 6.
                      
   -9, --best                                   
   -c, --stdout, --to-stdout                   This option specifies that output will go to the
                                               standard output stream, leaving files intact.
   -d, --decompress, --uncompress              This option selects decompression rather than com-
                                               pression.
   -f, --force                                 This option turns on force mode. This allows files
                                               with multiple links, symbolic links to regular files,
                                               overwriting of pre-existing files, reading from or
                                               writing to a terminal, and when combined with the -c
                                               option, allowing non-compressed data to pass through
                                               unchanged.
   -h, --help                                  This option prints a usage summary and exits.
   -k, --keep                                  This option prevents gzip from deleting input files
                                               after (de)compression.
   -L, --license                               This option prints gzip license.
   -l, --list                                  This option displays information about the file's
                                               compressed and uncompressed size, ratio, uncompressed
                                               name. With the -v option, it also displays the com-
                                               pression method, CRC, date and time embedded in the
                                               file.
   -N, --name                                  This option causes the stored filename in the input
                                               file to be used as the output file.
   -n, --no-name                               This option stops the filename and timestamp from be-
                                               ing stored in the output file.
   -q, --quiet                                 With this option, no warnings or errors are printed.
   -r, --recursive                             This option is used to gzip the files in a directory
                                               tree individually, using the fts(3) library.
   -S suffix, --suffix suffix                  This option changes the default suffix from .gz to
                                               suffix.
   -t, --test                                  This option will test compressed files for integrity.
   -V, --version                               This option prints the version of the gzip program.
   -v, --verbose                               This option turns on verbose mode, which prints the
                                               compression ratio for each file compressed.
