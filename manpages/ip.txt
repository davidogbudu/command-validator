SYNOPSIS
       ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       ip [ -force ] -batch filename

       OBJECT := { address | addrlabel | fou | help | ila | ioam | l2tp
               | link | macsec | maddress | monitor | mptcp | mroute |
               mrule | neighbor | neighbour | netconf | netns | nexthop
               | ntable | ntbl | route | rule | sr | tap | tcpmetrics |
               token | tunnel | tuntap | vrf | xfrm }

       OPTIONS := { -V[ersion] | -h[uman-readable] | -s[tatistics] |
               -d[etails] | -r[esolve] | -iec | -f[amily] { inet | inet6
               | link } | -4 | -6 | -B | -0 | -l[oops] { maximum-addr-
               flush-attempts } | -o[neline] | -rc[vbuf] [size] |
               -t[imestamp] | -ts[hort] | -n[etns] name | -N[umeric] |
               -a[ll] | -c[olor] | -br[ief] | -j[son] | -p[retty] }

OPTIONS
   -V, -Version                             Print the version of the ip utility and exit.

   -h, -human, -human-readable              Output statistics with human readable values followed by suffix.

   -b, -batch <FILENAME>                    Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke them. First failure will cause termination of ip.

   -force                                   Don't terminate ip on errors in batch mode. If there were any errors during execution of the commands, the application return code will be non zero.

   -s, -stats, -statistics                  Output more information. If the option appears twice or more, the amount of information increases. As a rule, the information is statistics or some time values.

   -d, -details                             Output more detailed information.

   -l, -loops <COUNT>                       Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip address flush' logic will attempt before giving up. The default is 10. Zero (0) means loop until all addresses are removed.

   -f, -family <FAMILY>                     Specifies the protocol family to use. The protocol family identifier can be one of inet, inet6, bridge, mpls or link. If this option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from other arguments. If the rest of the command line does not give enough information to guess the family, ip falls back to the default one, usually inet or any. link is a special family identifier meaning that no networking protocol is involved.

   -4                                       Shortcut for -family inet.

   -6                                       Shortcut for -family inet6.

   -B                                       Shortcut for -family bridge.

   -M                                       Shortcut for -family mpls.

   -0                                       Shortcut for -family link.

   -o, -oneline                             Output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with the '\' character. This is convenient when you want to count records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output.

   -r, -resolve                             Use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of host addresses.

   -n, -netns <NETNS>                       Switches ip to the specified network namespace NETNS. Actually it just simplifies executing of:

                                            ip netns exec NETNS ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

                                            to ip -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

   -N, -Numeric                             Print the number of protocol, scope, dsfield, etc directly instead of converting it to human readable name.

   -a, -all                                 Executes specified command over all objects, it depends if command supports this option.

   -c[color][={always|auto|never}]          Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or always, color output is enabled regardless of stdout state. If parameter is auto, stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling color output. If parameter is never, color output is disabled. If specified multiple times, the last one takes precedence. This flag is ignored if -json is also given.

                                            Used color palette can be influenced by COLORFGBG environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT).

   -t, -timestamp                           Display current time when using monitor option.

   -ts, -tshort                             Like -timestamp, but use shorter format.

   -rc, -rcvbuf <SIZE>                      Set the netlink socket receive buffer size, defaults to 1MB.

   -iec                                      Print human readable rates in IEC units (e.g. 1Ki = 1024).

   -br, -brief                              Print only basic information in a tabular format for better readability. This option is currently only supported by ip addr show, ip link show & ip neigh show commands.

   -j, -json                                Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

   -p, -pretty                              The default JSON format is compact and more efficient to parse but hard for most users to read. This flag adds indentation for readability.

   -echo                                    Request the kernel to send the applied configuration back.
