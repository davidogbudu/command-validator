NAME  
    chown - Change owner, change the user and/or group ownership of each given file to a new owner.
            `chown` can also change the ownership of a file to match the user/group of an existing reference file.

SYNOPSIS  
    chown [OPTIONS]... NEWOWNER FILE...

    chown [OPTIONS]... :GROUP FILE...

    chown [OPTIONS]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION  
    The `chown` command changes the ownership of a file or directory. The new ownership can be specified by a combination of user and group.

OWNER/GROUP SPECIFICATION  
    [OWNER] [ [:.] [GROUP] ]

    Examples:
    - OWNER              		- Change the owner of the file.
    - OWNER.GROUP or OWNER:GROUP  	- Change both the owner and group of the file.
    - OWNER. or OWNER:    		- Change the owner and set the group to OWNER’s login group.
    - .GROUP or :GROUP    		- Change only the group of the file.

OPTIONS  
    -c, --changes              Verbosely describe the action for each FILE whose ownership actually changes.

        --dereference          Do not act on symbolic links themselves but rather on what they point to.

    -f, --silent, --quiet      Do not print error messages about files whose ownership cannot be changed.
    
    -h, --no-dereference       Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to. 
                               This is the default. Relies on the 'lchown' system call. On systems that do not provide the 'lchown' system call, 
                               'chown' fails when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link.

        --reference=FILE       Use the user and group of the reference FILE instead of an explicit NEWOWNER value.
    
    -R, --recursive            Recursively change ownership of directories and their contents. 
                               Take care to not run recursive `chown` on the root '/' directory or any other system directory.
    
    -v, --verbose              Verbosely describe the action (or non-action) taken for every FILE. If a symbolic link is encountered during a recursive traversal on a system without the 'lchown' system call, 
                               and '--no-dereference' is in effect, then issue a diagnostic saying neither the symbolic link nor its referent is being changed.

EXAMPLE
    chown user:group file.txt
    chown -R user:group directory/
